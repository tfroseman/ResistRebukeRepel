    <h1>Three Words</h1>

</header>
<p>Three words. That is all. Three words will potentially define how we live the next four years.. Resist. Rebuke. Repel. Fascism is very much alive and well make no mistake. Tragically in recent years it has seen a more outward resurgence across the spectrum from local, through and firmly installed at national levels. It is the American duty to combat fascist regimes in our homeland. Use your voice to resist, rebuke, and repel. With these words we will challenge fascism. We will wield them to protect our friends or family or loved ones. Even those whom we do not yet know, for someday soon they may not be able to use these words on their own. We must use them to fight for the safety of others and against the imminent shadow before us. As commonly attributed to Edmund Burke, all that&rsquo;s needed for evil to flourish, is for good men is to do nothing. It then behoves us to stand and be the ones to do something.</p>
<h2 id="resist">Resist</h2>
<p>Resistance can appear in a multitude of ways. Resistance to influence. The call of fascism is easy to fall prey to, you must resist the siren&rsquo;s call.In trying times, when the will is weak, it will feel inevitable and burdensome to continue. We can not let our guard down. Even during the early stages it will be easy to dismiss the outward appearance as nothing more passing discourse. The same vigilance earnestness must be used on day one and on the final day. We must resist the influence to prevent its cancerous fangs from taking hold. You must resist, for not everyone will have an unassailable resolve. A keystone supports all who depend on it. The strongest resolve rises all. The more Fascism grows, the more its influence will become difficult even for the most stalwart to continue resisting. Supporters will be more outward and the influence will be unmistakable. You must remain strong in the face of adversity. Once taken hold, we remain resolute in our resolve and resist outward actions. If we can not prevent its root, we will inhibit its growth.</p>
<h2 id="rebuke">Rebuke</h2>
<p>It will take courage and we can not display hesitation. At one point or another we may face a stranger, friend, family. You must rebuke them for their actions. If you do not, they will continue to spread their influence unchecked. Showing that we are not afraid of fascism will encourage others to stand up with us. With one step you can change the course of history. Simple actions to show current behavior is reprehensible can be enough to prevent further developments and provide a much needed wake up. There is the reality that this might not change an individual&rsquo;s behavior. And that is okay. One voice turns into two, into three. And the more voices that decry actions and speech of the current administration shows that we will not sit back and watch idly as a democracy is stripped for parts and sold to the highest bidder. A nation for all requires a nation that stands against a regime that seeks to classify a single one of us as an enemy of the state.</p>
<h2 id="repel">Repel</h2>
<p>Fascism has no place in modern society. That was decided not that long ago. Tragically it has become plainly apparent that there are those who seem to relish the idea of ushering in ideologies incongruent with a functional democracy. At every interaction we will rally against and remove from power those who seek to dismantle a democracy of the people. Today we take one step, tomorrow we will take another, and the next day, and the next day until we successfully repel the forces that seek to take freedom from us. Before us is a march with no certainty of dawn ahead. So spread this message far and wide. We will not back down in the face of tyranny. If there are 1000 voices, I am one of them. If there are 100 voices, I am one of them. If there are 10 voices, I am one of them. If there is one voice, it is me. If there are no voices, I have been silenced.</p>
